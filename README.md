# yelpCamp - Now known as Let's camp.

This was done through a class on Udemy and I have added more features to it and I have more that I want to add.

## Whats been added so far:
- Contact Page
- Google reCaptcha v2 to protect against spam user creation, also implemented in the comment page.
- Image upload for the campgrounds (followed a tutorial from on of the Instructors) vs image being linked by a URL... which was a pain
- Implented the image upload code to the user profile (done on my own) because I wanted all the image uploads to be uniform vs having one store an image locally and the other use a URL to link the photo offsite.
- Fuzzy Search ... Basically, if you enter the letter "a" into the search bar and click submit, it will return all campgrounds with the letter "a" in it.  
- Style overhaul:
	- Changed colors of the Navbar and added a footer.
    - Changed the fonts and added letter spacing
    - Created a shadow effect on the user profile to imitate a contact card.

## What I want to add down the road:
1. I would love to eventually get rid of reCaptcha from the registration form and just use email verification. That way if a spam bot creates an account and doesn't verify the account then that user is never created and its placeholder information gets deleted.

2. Another thing I want to work on is giving the user the option to delete their account if they want to. And giving the admin users the option to delete a user if necessary.

3. And for now, the last thing I can think of, and this goes along with the second item in this list... Is being able to create an admin control panel of sorts that will list all user accounts along with their information like:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email Address
   - User Name
   - The ablilty to make someone admin or not an admin with radio buttons
   - And delete user
